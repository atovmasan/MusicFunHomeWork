```

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Through these homework assignments, I'm mastering:

- **React Fundamentals** (Components, Props, State, Lifecycle)
- **TypeScript Integration** (Typing, Interfaces, Generics)
- **State Management** (useState, useContext, Redux)
- **Side Effects** (useEffect, Redux Thunk)
- **Routing** (React Router DOM)
- **HTTP Communication** (Axios, REST API)
- **Modern JavaScript** (ES6+ features, Async/Await)
- **Development Tools** (React DevTools, Redux DevTools)

## 📖 How to Navigate

1. **Explore specific homework folder:**
   Each homework is located in its own directory with complete source code.

2. **Check TodoList project evolution:**
   The `todolist-project` folder contains the progressive development of a TodoList application across different homeworks.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- React 18+
- TypeScript
- Redux / Redux Toolkit
- React Router DOM
- Axios
- CSS Modules
- HTML5
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## 📝 Homework Topics

| Homework | Topic | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | JavaScript Fundamentals | ES6+ features, functions, arrays, objects |
| 2 | React Components | Functional components, props, event handling |
| 3 | State Management | useState, useEffect, custom hooks |
| 4 | Redux | State management, actions, reducers |
| 5 | HTTP & API | REST API integration, Axios, async operations |
| 6 | Advanced Patterns | HOCs, render props, context API |
...

## 🗂️ TodoList Project

The `todolist-project/` folder contains a comprehensive TodoList application that evolves with each homework, implementing:

- Task creation, editing, deletion
- State management evolution (local state → Redux)
- API integration for persistent storage
- Advanced features and optimizations

## 🚀 Getting Started
